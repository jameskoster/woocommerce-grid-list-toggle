Adds a grid/list view toggle to product archives

== Description ==

WooCommerce Grid / List view is a simple plugin which adds a Grid / List toggle to your product archives allowing users to, you guessed it, toggle between grid / list views of your products.

The list view arranges products in a vertical list and pulls in the excerpt to give a more detailed overview.

The grid view you will be familiar with as this is WooCommerce's default layout for product archives.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It doesn't work with my theme, what gives? =

You may see varied results depending on how the theme has been built and whether it's already pulling the excerpt into product archives. I've tried to cover all bases with CSS but you may occasionally need to make your own adjustments.

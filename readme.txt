Adds a grid/list view toggle to product archives

== Description ==

WooCommerce Grid / List toggle is a simple plugin which adds a grid / list toggle button to your product archives allowing users to toggle between grid / list views of your products on your WooCommerce store.

The list view arranges products in a vertical list and pulls in the excerpt to give a more detailed overview.

The grid view you will be familiar with as this is WooCommerce's default layout for product archives.

The store owner can choose whether grid or list view be set as the default via the "WooCommerce" > "Product Catalog" section of the Customizer.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `woocommerce-grid-list-toggle` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Choose the default setting on the catalog tab of the WooCommerce settings screen
4. Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It doesn't work with my theme, what gives? =

You may see varied results depending on how the theme has been built and whether it's already pulling the excerpt into product archives. I've tried to cover all bases with CSS but it's likely you'll need to make your own adjustments. WooCommerce Grid / List toggle has been tested with Twenty Ten, Twenty Eleven and Twenty Twelve.

= I found and fixed a bug how can I help? =
Thanks! Please fork the repo on <a href="https://github.com/jameskoster/woocommerce-grid-list-toggle">github</a>, push your fix then send a pull request.

= I don't like the button styles, how can I remove them and start fresh? =
Add the following code to the functions.php file in your theme / child theme:

`
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'remove_gridlist_styles', 30 );
function remove_gridlist_styles() {
	wp_dequeue_style( 'grid-list-button' );
}
`

That will remove the button styles but keep the layout styles which will allow you to design the buttons as you see fit.

To remove the layout styles as well use:

`
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'remove_gridlist_styles', 30);
function remove_gridlist_styles() {
	wp_dequeue_style( 'grid-list-button' );
	wp_dequeue_style( 'grid-list-layout' );
}
`
